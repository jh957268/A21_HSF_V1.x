 *  \brief HTTP Client Module
 *
 * The HTTP Client module implements the functionality to perform HTTP
 * operations like GET and POST on a remote web server. The HTTP client handles
 * chunked encoding making it transparent to the user. It also supports
 * persistent connections with the web server. Multiple HTTP requests can thus
 * be channelled through the same persistent connection with the server.
 *
 * \section httpc_usage Usage
 *
 * The typical HTTP Client usage scenario is as follows:
 *
 * -# Initiate a connection with the remote Web Server using the
 *    http_open_session() call.
 * -# Prepare the request with a call to http_prepare_req. The mandatory
 *    fields are filled depending on the members set in httpc_req_t. If some
 *    default fields are to be set, this is set by enabling the
 *    corresponding flag bits passed to http_prepare_req. If more custom
 *    headers are to be added please add them using the call add_header.
 * -# Send one or more HTTP requests to the server using the
 *    http_prepare_req and http_send_request pair together. . The \ref
 *    httpc_req_t structure should be populated with the desired fields for
 *    each call if changed
 * -# An optional call to http_get_response_hdr() can be made if the application
 *    wishes to determine certain characteristics of the HTTP response.
 * -# Mutiple calls to http_read_content() are made for reading the response of
 *    the remote Web Server.
 * -# Once all the HTTP requests have been made, the connection with the remote
 *    server is terminated using the http_close_session() call.
 *
